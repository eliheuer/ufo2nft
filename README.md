# ufo2nft

`ufo2nft` is a CLI Rust program created by Eli Heuer at the 2022 Seattle Solana Hacker House event.
It uses Norad to create on-chain SVGs images from UFO font sources, and prepares them for minting as Solana NFTs.
For Ethereum NFTs the program can just export the SVGs and Ethereum NFTs can be build manually.
